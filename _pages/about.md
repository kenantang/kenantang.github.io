I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UCSB, working under the supervision of Professor [Yao Qin](https://yaoqin1.github.io/). My research involves different areas including AI for Healthcare (specifically for Type 1 Diabetes), LLM-based language learning assistants, and image editing models. I obtained my B.S. in computer science and B.A. in physics from the University of Chicago. Outside of research, I worked as a Japanese-Chinese translator in a team that translates daily livestream content for over 1 million subscribers.
