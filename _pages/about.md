I am a 2nd-year PhD student in Computer Science at UCSB, working under the supervision of Professor [Yao Qin](https://yaoqin1.github.io/). My research involves two different fields of AI + Science and LLM writing assistants, with a focus on developing competent and interpretable methods that accelerate scientific research. I obtained my B.S. in computer science and B.A. in physics from the University of Chicago. Outside of research, I worked as a Japanese-Chinese translator in a team that translates daily livestream content for over 1 million subscribers.
