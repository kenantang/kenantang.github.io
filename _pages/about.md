I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UCSB, working under the supervision of Professor [Yao Qin](https://yaoqin1.github.io/). My research involves different areas including:
1. AI for Healthcare, specifically for **Type 1 Diabetes**.
2. Iterative **image editing** methods. Our [latest work](https://openreview.net/forum?id=tY3Jvs5jwN) from NeurIPS 2025 has been implemented as a [Photoshop plugin](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/cc/c09047be/spice).
3. AI safety, specifically [time-sensitive evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08598), [**prompt sensitivity**](https://aclanthology.org/2025.emnlp-main.1006/), and [distribution shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22829).
4. LLM-based **language learning** assistants. Here is a high-quality [LLM-generated dictionary](https://daily-dictionary.streamlit.app/) I use every day to learn Korean and Spanish.

Please see my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xgU9VfcAAAAJ&hl=en) for the full publication list. I am also actively sharing datasets and blog posts from my research on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/kenantang) and [Substack](https://substack.com/@kenantang1).

I obtained my B.S. in computer science and B.A. in physics from the University of Chicago. Outside of research, I worked as a Japanese-Chinese translator in a team that translates daily livestream content for over 1 million subscribers.
